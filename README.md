Hi. It's ML project for email spam detection. It's my project for my internship.
Here Ham represents Valid Emails while rest are As Spam. 
First performed Data pre-processing and perform label encoding as 0  and 1.
Also perform test train split for training and testing model to avoid over fitting etc. 
Countvectorizer is helpful to convert text to numbers. Making vectors of each word in corpus. 
Then I trained model using Nave bayes technique MutinomialNB. Also check accuracy and makes predictions...
